Postmortem: Network Nuisance Uncovered

Issue Summary:
On May 13, 2024, between 9:00 AM and 11:30 AM, our web application faced a partial outage due to network connectivity issues. Approximately 40% of active users encountered slow page loads and intermittent connection errors. The root cause was traced back to a network misconfiguration causing packet loss and increased latency.

Timeline:
9:00 AM: Monitoring systems flagged unusual network latency and packet loss rates.
9:05 AM: The networking team sprang into action, initiating an investigation into the connectivity hiccup.
9:15 AM: Preliminary analysis hinted at a potential misconfiguration in the network routing protocols.
9:30 AM: Deep dive into router configurations and routing tables for anomalies.
10:00 AM: Suspicions confirmed; an erroneous routing entry was disrupting traffic flow.
10:15 AM: Immediate action taken to rectify the misconfiguration and restore normal routing paths.
11:00 AM: Network performance stabilized; ongoing monitoring to ensure sustained improvements.
11:30 AM: System fully recovered, incident closed with lessons learned.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The outage stemmed from a network misconfiguration, specifically an erroneous routing entry diverting traffic into a congested path, resulting in packet loss and latency spikes. To remedy the situation:
1. Corrected the routing entry to restore optimal traffic flow.
2. Conducted thorough reviews of routing protocols and configurations to prevent similar issues.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To fortify our network infrastructure against future disruptions, we propose the following actions:
1. Implement automated checks for routing table consistency and integrity.
2. Enhance network monitoring tools to detect anomalies in real-time and trigger alerts promptly.
3. Conduct regular audits of network configurations to catch and rectify potential misconfigurations early.
4. Establish redundancy and failover mechanisms to mitigate the impact of single point failures.
5. Invest in network capacity planning to anticipate and accommodate future growth and traffic demands.
6. Conduct training sessions for network engineers on best practices for routing and configuration management.
